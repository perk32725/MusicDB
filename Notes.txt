# Start at the controller:
# Controllers/HomeControllers.cs
# has class HomeController : Controller
# has functions for each page in Views/Home/*.cshtml
# use Views/Home/About.cshtml to experiment
# use Views/Home/Index.cshtml to comment out the Carousel as well as other stuff
# need to figure out some models


# Models:     Classes that represent the data of the app
# Views:      Displays the model data
# Controller: Classes that handle browser requests
# Every public method in a controller is callable as an HTTP endpoint.
